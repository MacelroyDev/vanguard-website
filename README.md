# Fictitious Company Website & Employee Portal

A satirical website commission designed to mimic the look and feel of real corporate company websites, complete with a fully functional "Employee Portal" housing various internal tools.

## About This Project

This project was commissioned as a parody of corporate web presence, featuring an authentic-looking company website alongside an employee-only portal with genuinely useful tools.

## Features

### Public Website
- Corporate-style landing page
- About us, services, and contact sections
- "Authentic" buzzword-laden copy

### Employee Portal Tools
The "internal" employee portal includes several commissioned tools:

The following tools will be split into their own dedicated repositories:
